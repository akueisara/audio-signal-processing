# Sinusoidal model

## 1. The sinusoidal model assumes that a sound can be modeled as
* a sum of time-varying sinusoids

## 2. The frequency of a sinusoid in the spectrum can be obtained by
* measuring the location of the spectral peak corresponding to the sinusoid

## 3. To distinguish two sinusoids having a frequency distance of delta-f we have to select a window
* whose spectral main lobe is narrower than delta-f

## 4. A spectral peak is detected by
* finding a local maxima in the magnitude spectrum

## 5. With parabolic interpolation we can
* improve the frequency, magnitude, and phase measure of a spectral peak

## 6. Time-varying sinusoids can be identified by
* tracking the location of spectral peaks in time

## 7. To synthesize a sinusoid in the spectral domain we can
* generate the spectrum of a window and place it at the location of the desired sinusoid

## 8. The duration of the time domain sinusoid obtained by performing the inverse FFT of its spectrum is equal to
* the size of the FFT used

## 9. The reason for using the main-lobe of the spectrum of the Blackman-Harris window for the sinusoidal synthesis is because
* with just 8 samples we can generate a sinusoid in the spectrum

## 10. The size of the inverse FFT used in the sinusoidal synthesis discussed in class
* does not have to be the same than the FFT size used in the analysis of the sinusoids
